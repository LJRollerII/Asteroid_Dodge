# Asteroid Dodge

**<u>Synopsis</u>**

For this project I've created a side scrolling game using Scratch that tests the player's concentration and reflex speed.

**<u>How it works</u>**

The game let's a player use the up and down keys to navigate a rocketship around asteroids. The "Warp Speed" slider controls the speed of the game, and the rate at which the asteroids appear increases as the game progresses. Any contact between the rocketship and an asteroid ends the game.
